    "\n",
    "1. Opening and closing files\n",
    "2. Reading and writing text files\n",
    "3. Reading and writing binary files\n",
    "4. Using the `with` statement\n",
    "5. Using the `pickle` module\n",
    "6. Serializing objects with `pickle`\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics. To open a file, we use the built-in `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two arguments: the name of the file to open and the mode in which to open it. The mode can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'r'` - open for reading (default)\n",
    "* `'w'` - open for writing, truncating the file first\n",
    "* `'x'` - open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists\n",
    "* `'a'` - open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists\n",
    "* `'b'` - binary mode\n",
    "* `'t'` - text mode (default)\n",
    "* `'+'` - open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this tutorial more interesting, let's create a purpose for our code. Our goal is to create a logging system for players and their rolls. Every time a player rolls, we will add it to our log. We will also add a timestamp to each roll. We will store the log in a file called `log.txt`."
